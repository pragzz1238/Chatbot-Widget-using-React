# Chatbot with ChatGPT API, React, and Express.js

This is a simple Chatbot project that utilizes the ChatGPT API service from OpenAI. The Chatbot allows users to input prompts and receive responses generated by the ChatGPT model. The project is built using React for the front-end and Express.js for the back-end.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager): This comes with Node.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pragzz1238/Chatbot-Widget-using-React.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Chatbot-Widget-using-React

3. Install the required dependencies for both the front-end and back-end:

   ```bash
   # Install front-end dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
    
   # Install back-end dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install

## Configuration

To configure the project to work with the ChatGPT API, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenAI:

1. Visit the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
2. Sign up for an account and follow the instructions to get API access.
3. Once you have the API key, replace the variable "OPENAI_API_KEY" with your API key in `.env` file in the `backend` directory of the project.

## Usage

1. Start the back-end Express.js server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   The server should start on http://localhost:8081.

2. Start the React front-end:
   
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The React development server should start on http://localhost:3000.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Chatbot.

4. Enter a prompt in the input field, and the Chatbot will send the prompt to the ChatGPT API and display the response.
